            <h1>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</h1>
            <p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I love you, buddy! Fatal. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
            <p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Why would I want to know that? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! <strong> Oh right.</strong> <em> I forgot about the battle.</em> Shut up and take my money!</p>
            <h2>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</h2>
            <p>Shinier than yours, meatbag. Kids have names? And until then, I can never die? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</li><li>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</li><li>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Negative, bossy meat creature!</h3>
            <p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</li><li>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</li><li>Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>
            <p>Yeah, lots of people did. You are the last hope of the universe. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! A sexy mistake.</p>
            <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
            <p>No, I'm Santa Claus! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? And until then, I can never die?</p>
            <p>No! The cat shelter's on to me. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! A sexy mistake. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
            <p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Leela's gonna kill me. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Why would I want to know that?</p>
            <p>Bite my shiny metal ass. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Ummm…to eBay?</p>
            <p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
            <p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Meh. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</p>
            <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
            <p>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Take me to your leader! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.</p>

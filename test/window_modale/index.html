            <h1>No. We're on the top.</h1>
<p>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? No! Don't jump! Kif might!</p>
<p>Oh right. I forgot about the battle. It's toe-tappingly tragic! No! <strong> Don't jump!</strong> <em> I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.</em> Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
<h2>Daylight and everything.</h2>
<p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? You know, I was God once. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</p>
<ol>
<li>No! The cat shelter's on to me.</li><li>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</li><li>Bender, you risked your life to save me!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</h3>
<p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</p>
<ul>
<li>I never loved you.</li><li>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</li><li>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Throw her in the brig. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
<p>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Negative, bossy meat creature! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
<p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Is that a cooking show?</p>
<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. What are their names? I'll get my kit! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</p>
<p>Leela's gonna kill me. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Professor, make a woman out of me. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</p>
<p>Take me to your leader! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
<p>Can I use the gun? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>
<p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Say it in Russian! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! We're rescuing ya.</p>
<p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
<p>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Daylight and everything. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</p>
<p>She also liked to shut up! Bender?! You stole the atom. We're rescuing ya. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</p>
